## Problem This Solves

<!-- What's the current limitation or missing piece? Why does it matter to players? -->

## Proposed Solution

<!-- Describe the feature. Be specific — "add more crops" is less useful than "add hemp with N=0.22, P=0.09, K=0.18 extraction rates" -->

## How It Would Feel In-Game

<!-- Walk through the player experience. What do they do, what do they see? -->
<!-- If it's a UI change, a rough sketch or description of where it lives helps -->

## Alternatives You've Considered

<!-- Other ways this could work, or workarounds you currently use -->

## Relevant Architecture Notes

<!-- Optional — if you've read DEVELOPMENT.md and know which files would be involved, mention them -->
<!-- e.g. "This would be a new entry in Constants.lua CROP_EXTRACTION" -->

## Anything Else

<!-- Related issues, links, references, or prior art from other mods -->
