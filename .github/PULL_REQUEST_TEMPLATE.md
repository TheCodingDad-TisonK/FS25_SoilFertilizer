## Checklist

- [ ] I read `DEVELOPMENT.md` before writing code
- [ ] I targeted the `development` branch (not `main`)
- [ ] My change touches only what it needs to — no unrelated edits
- [ ] If I added a setting: one entry in `SettingsSchema.lua` + `_short`/`_long` translations in `modDesc.xml` for all 10 languages
- [ ] If I changed crop/fertilizer values: they're in `Constants.lua`, not hardcoded
- [ ] If I changed behaviour: `CHANGELOG.md` has an entry under the correct version
- [ ] No `assert()` calls — errors are handled gracefully with `pcall()`
- [ ] No Lua 5.2+ syntax (`goto`, `continue`, `os.time()`, etc.)
