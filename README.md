> *"Applied liquid fertilizer three seasons straight because the yield looked fine. Then I checked the pH — it was sitting at 5.4. The nutrients I'd been pouring in couldn't even be absorbed. One application of lime later and the next harvest told the whole story."*

<br>

**In base FS25, every field is born equal and stays that way forever. This mod remembers.**

Each field builds its own history. Nitrogen drops after a heavy wheat crop. Rain washes potassium out of sandy ground. Fallow fields slowly breathe back to life. The numbers you see in the HUD aren't arbitrary — they're the consequence of every harvest, every storm, and every bag of fertilizer you did or didn't apply.

## ✨ Features

### 🧪 Per-Field Soil Chemistry

Five values tracked independently for every field on the map:

| | Nutrient | Role | Depleted By |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🟢 | **Nitrogen (N)** | Growth and leaf mass | Harvest, rain leaching, fall season |
| 🔵 | **Phosphorus (P)** | Root development and energy | Harvest |
| 🟡 | **Potassium (K)** | Water regulation and yield quality | Harvest, rain leaching |
| 🟤 | **Organic Matter (OM)** | Soil structure and nutrient buffering | Builds slowly via manure and plowing |
| ⚗️ | **pH** | Unlocks nutrient availability | Rain acidification — raised by lime and plowing |

All five values persist in your save. A field that's been growing canola for three seasons without lime will feel different from one you've been managing carefully.

### 🌾 Crop-Specific Extraction

Different crops take different amounts from your soil. Push the same field too hard and it shows.

| Crop | N drain | P drain | K drain | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 🥔 Potato | ●●●●● | ●●●● | ●●●●● | Extreme K demand — must rotate |
| 🟣 Sugar Beet | ●●●●○ | ●●●○○ | ●●●●● | Heaviest K of any crop |
| 🌻 Sunflower | ●●●●○ | ●●●○○ | ●●●●○ | Moderate-high all round |
| 🌼 Canola | ●●●●○ | ●●●○○ | ●●●●○ | High N demand, oilseed crop |
| 🫘 Soybean | ●●●●● | ●●●○○ | ●●●○○ | Highest N — partial fixation assumed |
| 🌽 Maize | ●●●●○ | ●●●○○ | ●●●●○ | Large biomass, needs N and K |
| 🌾 Wheat | ●●●○○ | ●●○○○ | ●●●○○ | Moderate — manageable with rotation |
| 🌾 Barley / Oats / Rye | ●●●○○ | ●●○○○ | ●●●○○ | Light feeders, good rotation crops |
| 🫛 Peas / Beans | ●●●●○ | ●●●○○ | ●●●●○ | Legumes — still need balanced soil |

### 🔄 Crop Rotation

The mod tracks the last **3 harvested crops** per field and actively rewards good rotation practice — and penalises lazy mono-cropping.

| Situation | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Legume → Non-legume** (soybean, peas, or beans last season) | +0.5 N/day for the first 3 days of spring — nitrogen fixation carry-over |
| **Same crop two seasons running** | ×1.15 extraction multiplier on that harvest — 15% extra depletion across N, P, and K |
| **Healthy alternation** | No modifier in either direction |

The Soil Report now shows your rotation status per field alongside the nutrient recommendations: *Rotation Bonus*, *Fatigue: Same Crop*, or *Rotation: OK*. History is saved with your savegame and synced in multiplayer. Can be toggled off in settings.

### 🐛 Field Health System

Three pressure scores (0–100) track threats to each field independently. Left unchecked they reduce your actual harvest yield — fewer liters in the combine hopper, less money at the sell point. Treat them with the right product and the pressure drops within a few days.

| Pressure | Source | Treatment | Resets naturally | Max penalty |
|----------|--------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| 🌿 **Weed** | Grows daily — peaks without tillage | `HERBICIDE` spray | Any tillage / plowing | −30% |
| 🐞 **Pest** | Insects — peaks in summer | `INSECTICIDE` spray | Harvest disperses population | −30% |
| 🍄 **Disease** | Fungal — driven by rain | `FUNGICIDE` spray | 3+ dry days cause natural decay | −25% |

All three are visible in the HUD and the full Soil Report. Each can be toggled off in settings.

### 💊 Fertilizer Types

25+ products tracked, each with a different nutrient job.

**Base game (always available):**

| Fertilizer | N | P | K | Organic Matter | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Liquid Fertilizer** | ●●●○○ | ●●○○○ | ●●●○○ | — | Fast-acting, balanced NPK |
| **Solid Fertilizer** | ●●●●○ | ●●●○○ | ●●●○○ | — | Higher N/P, granular |
| **Manure** | ●●○○○ | ●○○○○ | ●●○○○ | ✓ | Slow-release, builds OM over time |
| **Slurry** | ●●●○○ | ●●○○○ | ●●●●○ | ✓ | Liquid organic, K-dominant (real N:P:K ratio) |
| **Digestate** | ●●●○○ | ●●○○○ | ●●●●○ | ✓ | Biogas byproduct, higher N availability than raw manure |
| **Lime** | — | — | — | — | Only raises pH — but nothing else works properly without it |

**Custom liquid fertilizers (purchasable IBC liquid tanks in shop):**

| Product | Type | Primary benefit |
|---|---|---|
| UAN-32 / UAN-28 | Liquid nitrogen | Highest N/L of liquid sources |
| Anhydrous Ammonia | Liquid nitrogen | Maximum N concentration |
| Starter 10-34-0 | Liquid P | In-furrow high-P starter |
| Liquid Urea | Liquid N | Dissolved urea for sprayer application |
| Liquid AMS | Liquid N | Liquid ammonium sulphate |
| Liquid MAP | Liquid P+N | High-P liquid blend |
| Liquid DAP | Liquid P+N | Liquid DAP equivalent |
| Liquid Potash | Liquid K | Dissolved potassium for sprayers |
| Insecticide | Liquid | Pest pressure treatment (sprayer) |
| Fungicide | Liquid | Disease pressure treatment (sprayer) |
| Liquid Lime | Liquid pH agent | Raises pH via sprayer — alternative to dry lime |

**Custom dry/solid fertilizers (purchasable big bags in shop):**

| Product | Type | Primary benefit |
|---|---|---|
| Urea / AMS | Dry nitrogen | Standard granular N sources |
| MAP / DAP | Dry P+N | Phosphorus-focused blends |
| Potash | Dry K | Pure potassium supplement |
| Gypsum | Dry amendment | Lowers pH and improves soil structure |
| Compost | Organic amendment | Best OM builder per application |
| Biosolids | Organic fertilizer | Municipal organic N+P amendment |
| Chicken Manure | Organic fertilizer | Concentrated N+P poultry litter |
| Pelletized Manure | Organic fertilizer | Dense balanced NPK+OM — highest analysis |

**Organic / soil amendments (nutrient profiles):**

| Product | Application | N | P | K | OM | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Compost** | Spreader | Low | Low | Low | ●●●●● | Best OM builder per litre |
| **Biosolids** | Spreader | ●●○○○ | ●●○○○ | Low | ✓ | Municipal organic amendment |
| **Chicken Manure** | Spreader | ●●●○○ | ●●●○○ | ●●○○○ | ✓ | Concentrated poultry litter |
| **Pelletized Manure** | Spreader | ●●●●○ | ●●●○○ | ●●●●○ | ✓ | Dense balanced organic NPK |
| **Gypsum** | Spreader | — | — | — | Low | Lowers pH, minor OM gain |
| **Liquid Lime** | Sprayer | — | — | — | — | Raises pH via sprayer equipment |

> [!NOTE]
> Organic matter builds slowly — it takes many seasons to accumulate meaningfully. Soil with high OM buffers pH swings and slows nutrient loss from rain.

### 🚜 Soil Compaction

Heavy vehicles compact the soil they drive over. Compaction is tracked per field (0–100%) and
gradually reduces how effectively the field can absorb nutrients.

| Threshold | Vehicle weight | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| **Compaction hit** | ≥ 8 t total (tractor + implement) | +2% compaction per day (once per game day) |
| **Subsoiler pass** | Any cultivator with `isSubsoiler = true` | −15% compaction per pass |
| **Natural decay** | Automatically | −0.5% per game day |

At maximum compaction (100%), the field's nutrient extraction penalty reaches **20%** — compacted
soil binds nutrients and reduces their availability to crops.

The HUD shows compaction as a colour-coded row (green < 20%, amber 20–60%, red > 60%). It also
appears as **overlay layer 10** on the in-game map. Compaction is saved to `soilData.xml` and
synced to all clients in multiplayer. Toggle it in settings if you prefer to skip this mechanic.

### 📊 Coverage Tracking

The sprayer now tracks which individual soil cells have been covered in an application pass.
Coverage fraction is shown live in the HUD as `Coverage: X% / 70% min`. The fully-treated
field notification is gated on achieving **70% minimum coverage** — a single-pass clip across
a field corner no longer triggers a false "field treated" popup.

### 🌦️ Environmental Effects

The mod isn't just about what you put in — it's about what the world takes out.

| Effect | What happens |
|---|---|
| 🌧️ **Rain leaching** | Nitrogen and potassium wash out during heavy rain. Phosphorus binds tightly and barely moves. |
| 🍂 **Fall nitrogen loss** | Biological activity slows in autumn, pulling N levels down naturally. |
| 🌱 **Spring nitrogen boost** | Microbial activity picks back up in spring, recovering a small amount of N. |
| 🌧️ **pH acidification** | Rain is slightly acidic. Ignore liming long enough and your soil will show it. |
| 🌾 **Fallow recovery** | Fields left unplanted for 7+ days slowly recover nutrients on their own. |
| 🚜 **Plowing bonus** | Aerates soil, nudging pH toward neutral and boosting organic matter mixing. |
| 🌿 **Residue incorporation** | Working post-harvest stubble back into the soil releases a small NPK and OM pulse from decomposing straw. Deeper tillage releases more; direct-drills release the least. |

### 🤖 Smart Precision Systems

Three in-vehicle overlay panels that appear when you enter a supported sprayer. Each appears as a collapsible HUD panel that can be independently repositioned in Free Panel Layout mode.

| System | What it does | How to enable |
|---|---|---|
| **Smart Sensor** | Monitors pest, disease, and nutrient need per section. Blocks spraying on sections with no active need detected. | Settings → Admin → Smart Systems. Works with any VWW sprayer. |
| **See & Spray** | Shows live per-cell pressure for pest, disease, and weed at the sprayer's current position. Colour-coded per section. | Purchase a **JD R700i** or **JD R975i** with the *See & Spray* shop configuration selected. |
| **Variable Rate** | Adjusts boom output rate per section based on soil deficits for the loaded product. Green bar = low rate; red bar = high rate. | Bind `SF_VARIABLE_RATE` in **Controls → Mods**. Enable in Admin → Smart Systems. |

Smart Sensor and Variable Rate work with any VWW-capable sprayer. **See & Spray requires the JD R700i (28 m) or JD R975i (36 m)** with the See & Spray option selected at purchase — base game sprayers are not tested with this feature.

**Free Panel Layout** — Enable in Settings → Display → Position, then use the Shift+H edit mode to drag each panel independently. Press **[−]** in any panel's title bar to collapse it to the title bar only. Positions and collapse states are saved to `hud.xml`.

### 📊 Soil HUD

A compact overlay shows the current field's soil status while you're working. Colour-coded indicators make problems visible at a glance:

🟢 **Green** — healthy, no action needed &nbsp;|&nbsp; 🟡 **Amber** — getting low, plan ahead &nbsp;|&nbsp; 🔴 **Red** — depleted, yield is being reduced

The **yield forecast row** (e.g. `Yield ~-18%`) is not just a warning — it reflects what the combine will actually collect. N/P/K deficits, weed, pest, and disease pressure all reduce real harvest liters. The HUD percentage is exactly the hit your tank takes.

Additional rows appear contextually: **Coverage** (`Coverage: X% / 70% min`) while a sprayer is active on a field, and **Compaction** (when soil compaction is above 0% and the setting is enabled). Both are colour-coded with the same green/amber/red tiers as nutrients.

Fully customisable: 5 positions, 4 colour themes, 5 transparency levels, 3 font sizes, and a compact mode that shrinks to one line per nutrient. The drag-to-reposition action (`SF_HUD_DRAG`, default: RMB) is now rebindable through the standard FS25 key bindings menu.

### 📋 Full Farm Soil Report

The **Farm Overview** tab in the Soil PDA page shows all your fields sorted by urgency — the fields that need the most attention appear at the top. Each row shows N/P/K, pH, OM, weed and pest pressure, and an overall status badge. Click any row to open a field detail popup with a complete breakdown, yield forecast, and specific treatment recommendations.

### 📱 Soil PDA Page

Press **`Shift+P`** to open the dedicated Soil & Fertilizer page inside the FS25 in-game menu (PDA). Accessible any time — on foot, in a vehicle, or while paused.

**Left sidebar** — live farm-wide snapshot updated each time the page opens:
- Fields tracked and fields owned
- Average N, P, K, pH, and Organic Matter across all your fields
- Weed, Pest, and Disease pressure field counts
- Fields currently below fertilizer threshold

**Two tabs:**

| Tab | What you see |
|---|---|
| **Farm Overview** | Full list of every tracked field — N%, P%, K%, pH, OM, and an overall status badge. Click any row to open a per-field detail popup |
| **Treatment Plan** | Fields sorted by urgency (worst first) with the primary deficiency or pressure identified. Minor-urgency fields grouped at the bottom |

The interactive **Soil Map overlay** lives in the native PDA Map (ESC → Map). Use the sidebar to select and cycle overlay layers (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, pH, OM, Weed, Pest, Disease) without leaving the game map.

**Field Detail popup** (click any row in Farm Overview or Treatment Plan):
- All five nutrient values with colour-coded Good / Fair / Poor status
- Weed, Pest, and Disease pressure — asterisk (`*`) shown when a protection product is active
- Last harvested crop and crop rotation status (Legume Bonus / Fatigue / OK)

## 🔌 Mod Integrations

All integrations are detected automatically at runtime and fail gracefully if the mod isn't installed.

| Mod | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| **FS25_precisionFarming** | **Incompatible.** When Precision Farming is detected as active, this mod automatically disables itself at startup to prevent data corruption. Disable PF in the mod manager to use this mod instead. |
| **FS25_SeasonalCropStress** | Soil pH and organic matter influence evapotranspiration rates per field. |
| **FS25_NPCFavor** | NPC neighbour favour quests can reference your fields' soil state. |
| **FS25_MoistureSystem** | Compatible — both mods use independent hooks. No conflicts. |

---

## 🛠️ Installation

**1. Download** `FS25_SoilFertilizer.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/TheCodingDad-TisonK/FS25_SoilFertilizer/releases/latest).

**2. Copy** the ZIP (do not extract) to your mods folder:

| Platform | Path |
|---|---|
| 🪟 Windows | `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\FarmingSimulator2025\mods\` |
| 🍎 macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/FarmingSimulator2025/mods/` |

**3. Enable** *Realistic Soil & Fertilizer* in the in-game mod manager.

**4. Load** any career save — soil data initialises automatically on first load.

---

## 🎮 Quick Start

```
1. Load your farm — the soil HUD appears in the top-right corner
2. Drive to any field — nutrient values update as you move
3. Amber or red values → that field needs fertilizer or lime
4. Apply lime first — it unlocks the full value of everything else
5. Apply fertilizer → watch N/P/K climb in real time
6. Open the tablet → Soil & Fertilizer → Farm Overview to see all fields by urgency
7. Press Shift+O → open the full settings panel to tune the simulation
8. Let a field go fallow for a season → it slowly recovers on its own
9. At harvest → healthy soil means the full yield you worked for
```

> [!TIP]
> Fields start slightly acidic and with moderate nutrients — matching the base game's starting state. Lime first, then fertilize. Nutrients in acidic soil have reduced availability no matter how much product you apply.

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

| Issue | Details |
|---|---|
| 🌱 **Base game lime indicator** | The base game's "needs liming" flag is a separate system from our pH tracking. Both update when you apply lime through the sprayer, but the indicators can show different states until the field is treated. Workaround: disable the base game's liming requirement in **Settings → Farming → Liming** to rely solely on our HUD. |
| 🌐 **Multiplayer** | Soil simulation runs on the server only. Clients receive synced state on join and after each harvest or fertiliser event. |
| ⚠️ **Section Control** | When outer boom sections are shut off at field boundaries, nutrient credit scales to the active fraction. Sections manually blocked by a Section Control mod may not be detected — credit is based on the sprayer's reported active sections, not physical coverage. |
